}
\value{
A dataframe containing summaries of nutrient inadequacy before and after fortification for different administrative groups.
}
\description{
This function calculates summaries of nutrient inadequacy before and after different fortification methods for different administrative groups using either the Adult Female Equivalent (AFE) Method, the Critical Nutrient Density (CND) Method, or both.
